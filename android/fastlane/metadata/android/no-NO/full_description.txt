This app implements an incident-based approach to real-time tracking where privacy by design is a primary concern. It is compliant with fundamental privacy law principles like fair use, data minimization and right to delete. Only authenticated and authorized users are able to see any locations.

Locations are only visible in context of an incident, which is defined by an initial planning point and a radius managed globally.
